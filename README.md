# PLP-PYTHON-OPP-ASSIGNMENT
This Python program demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts by modeling superheroes and moving entities using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

# 🦸‍♂️ PLP Python OOP Assignment – A Heroic Tale of Code

## 📜 The Story Behind the Code

Once upon a time in the realm of Pythonia, I, a humble Python programmer, was given a mighty quest—**Activity 1 & 2** of the PLP Python OOP assignment.

But this wasn't just any assignment. No. This was a **hero's journey**—a journey that began with imagination, moved through inheritance, and ended in the land of polymorphism and encapsulation.

## ✨ ACTIVITY 1: The Rise of the Superheroes

### 🌍 The Setting

In the mystical world of *Object-Oriented Programming*, I created a base class called `Superhero`. Each superhero had:

* A name
* A secret real age (yes, it's private!)
* A country
* An incredible coding strength
* And a superpower—the ability to turn Python code into functioning software

### 🧬 The Inheritance Begins

Two subclasses were born from the mighty `Superhero`:

* **Python\_Programmer** – a fearless coder with a billion-line strength
* **Python\_Teacher** – a wise mentor shaping minds and systems

Each subclass proudly announced its identity on creation, but they all inherited the essence and power of the Superhero class.

### 🧪 The Experiment

Meet **Vincent**, a Ghanaian Python Programmer. At just 32 years old, he could write a billion lines of Python in an hour (don’t try this at home). But we tried to change his real age—it didn’t work. Why? Because true ages are kept secret via *name mangling* (private variables).

Then came **Akomeah**, a teacher with the same mighty strength and a heart for transformation. He too stepped into the story and told the world about his superpowers.

## ⚙️ ACTIVITY 2: The Movement of Entities

With the superhero saga complete, I turned my attention to the everyday world. But even here, OOP magic flowed...

### 🚗 A New Class of Beings

I created a class called `Entity`. This wasn’t for superheroes, but for **things that move**. Each entity had:

* A name
* A form of movement

Then came the subclasses:

* `Car` – smooth and electric like **Tesla**
* `Bird` – free and feathered like the **Parrot**
* `Motor` – fast and fierce like a **Yamaha bike**

Each entity was created and asked to describe how it moved—and they did so proudly.

## 📦 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Object-Oriented Programming concepts:

  * Inheritance
  * Encapsulation
  * Class instantiation
  * Method overriding

---

## 🧠 Lessons from the Journey

* OOP is more than just code—it's storytelling with logic.
* Encapsulation protects what shouldn’t be touched (like a superhero’s age).
* Inheritance lets us reuse power and structure.
* Objects aren’t just data—they’re characters in the narrative of a program.

## ▶️ Running the Tale

To run this story on your own device:

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `superhero_story.py`
2. Run it using:

```bash
python superhero_story.py
```

Watch the magic unfold.

## 💬 Final Words

This assignment wasn’t just an exercise. It was a *saga*, a way to breathe life into logic. The world of Python isn’t just about functions and syntax—it’s about heroes, motion, and imagination.

**Keep coding. Keep storytelling.**
